This is a Timer application that allows users to set and run a timer.
Timers can be given a timer name and saved to a database.
A list of saved timers will appear on the main page of the application and can be selected at convenience.

This application is a re-design of my previous Timer application.
The previous application worked, but the interface and code were messy, and some features were missing.
The new version will implement SQLite, custom user controls, and the MVVM design pattern.

This application has not been fully implemented yet.
SQLite functionality has been implemented, but not tested.
